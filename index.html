    <p id="intro" class="intro">Hi, my name is Alex and this is my page appreciating the healing properties of the humble guitar solo. I chose this topic because it is something that captivates me - that allows me to access a state of flow which, over the course of the CYF Intro to Digital course, I have come to believe I may be able to emulate via coding.
    <br><br>
    Listening to a guitar solo is healing for me. It is healing because it brings me into the moment, into the present, where there is no regret of the past or fear of the future. There is no doubt in the present. There is no thought. There is only flow. I believe this experience exists for both the listener/user and for the player (look at the expressions in the pictures - they are lost in what they are doing, and experience this freedom from the external as ecstasy).
      <br><br>
      Coding appears to produce a similar state of flow for me. It isn't the same - yet - as my coding is at a very basic level. But the process of writing the code most definitely has the potential to be a flow activity for me - because it is absorbing. It brings me into the moment. It is healing.
      <br><br>
      And that is why I want to Code My Future.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p id="frusciante-text" class="frusciante-text">John Frusciante is a hero of mine. He is the on again/off again guitarist for the band Red Hot Chili Peppers. His solo's are the CSS of the guitar soloing world - all style, colour and aesthetics. I named this site after a track of his called 'Look On', which features a deceptively simple yet incredibly captivating guitar solo. It weaves and dips and never stays still. Check out the video!</p>

    <p id="gilmour-text" class="gilmour-text">David Gilmour was both the lead guitarist and singer of the seminal band Pink Floyd. His solo's are the HTML of the guitar soloing world - basic, structured and controlled, yet producing utter beauty. A track that always takes me to a place of peace and relaxation is 'Marooned'.

    <p id="hazel-text" class="hazel-text">Eddie Hazel is responsible for the truly iconic track 'Maggot Brain', which is just one long guitar solo. Hazel's solo's are, for me, the guitar world's equivalent of the product of combined HTML and CSS - the combination of technique and style. 'Maggot Brain' is pure flow.
